description: Spawn parallel research subagents and synthesize findings
---

Use the research-orchestration skill to spawn parallel research subagents and synthesize findings.

**Prerequisites:**
- Brainstorm completed
- Feature concept defined

**What this does:**
1. Analyzes brainstorm context
2. Suggests researchers (Codebase, Library docs, Web, GitHub)
3. Allows user to adjust selection
4. Spawns up to 4 subagents in parallel
5. Synthesizes findings
6. Automatically saves to `YYYY-MM-DD-<feature>-research.md`

**Next step:** Writing implementation plan with research context
