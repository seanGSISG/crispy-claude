## Dependencies
- Previous tasks: none
- Must complete before: none

## Parallelizable
- Can run in parallel with: Task 1, Task 2, Task 3, Task 4, Task 5, Task 6, Task 7, Task 8, Task 10, Task 11, Task 12, Task 13, Task 14, Task 15, Task 16, Task 17, Task 18, Task 19, Task 20, Task 21, Task 22, Task 23, Task 24

## Implementation

**Files:**
- Create: `cc/skills/research-orchestration/SKILL.md`

**Step 1: Create skill directory**

```bash
mkdir -p cc/skills/research-orchestration
```

**Step 2: Write skill file**

Create `cc/skills/research-orchestration/SKILL.md`:

```markdown
# Research Orchestration

Use this skill to manage parallel research subagents and synthesize findings from multiple sources.

## When to Use

After brainstorming completes and user selects "B) research first" option.

## Selection Algorithm

### Default Selection

Based on brainstorm context, intelligently select researchers:

**serena-explorer** [✓ ALWAYS]
- Always need codebase understanding
- No keywords required - default ON

**context7-researcher** [✓ if library mentioned]
- Select if: new library, framework, official docs needed
- Keywords: "using [library]", "integrate [framework]", "best practices for [tool]"
- Example: "using React hooks" → ON

**web-researcher** [✓ if patterns mentioned]
- Select if: best practices, tutorials, modern approaches, expert opinions
- Keywords: "industry standard", "common pattern", "how to", "best approach"
- Example: "authentication best practices" → ON

**github-researcher** [☐ usually OFF]
- Select if: known issues, community solutions, similar features, troubleshooting
- Keywords: "GitHub issue", "others solved", "similar to [project]", "known problems"
- Example: "known issues with SSR" → ON

### User Presentation

Present recommendations with context:

```markdown
Based on the brainstorm, I recommend these researchers:

[✓] Codebase (serena-explorer)
    → Understand current architecture and integration points

[✓] Library docs (context7-researcher)
    → React hooks patterns and official recommendations

[✓] Web (web-researcher)
    → Authentication best practices and security patterns

[ ] GitHub (github-researcher)
    → Not needed unless we hit specific issues

Adjust selection? (Y/n)
```

If **Y**: Interactive toggle
```
Toggle researchers: (C)odebase (L)ibrary (W)eb (G)itHub (D)one
User input: L G D
Result: Toggled OFF context7-researcher, ON github-researcher, Done
```

If **n**: Use defaults and proceed

## Spawning Subagents

**Run up to 4 in parallel** using Task tool:

```typescript
// Spawn all selected researchers in parallel
const results = await Promise.all([
  // Always spawn serena-explorer
  Task({
    subagent_type: "serena-explorer",
    description: "Explore codebase architecture",
    prompt: `
      Analyze the current codebase for ${feature} implementation.

      Find:
      - Current architecture relevant to ${feature}
      - Similar existing implementations we can learn from
      - Integration points where ${feature} should hook in
      - Patterns used in similar features

      Provide all findings with file:line references.
    `
  }),

  // Conditionally spawn context7-researcher
  ...(useContext7 ? [Task({
    subagent_type: "context7-researcher",
    description: "Research library documentation",
    prompt: `
      Research official documentation for ${libraries}.

      Find:
      - Recommended patterns for ${useCase}
      - API best practices and examples
      - Security considerations
      - Performance recommendations

      Include Context7 IDs, benchmark scores, and code examples.
    `
  })] : []),

  // Conditionally spawn web-researcher
  ...(useWeb ? [Task({
    subagent_type: "web-researcher",
    description: "Research best practices",
    prompt: `
      Search for ${topic} best practices and expert opinions.

      Find:
      - Industry standard approaches for ${useCase}
      - Recent articles (2024-2025) on ${topic}
      - Expert recommendations with rationale
      - Common gotchas and solutions

      Cite sources with authority assessment and publication dates.
    `
  })] : []),

  // Conditionally spawn github-researcher
  ...(useGithub ? [Task({
    subagent_type: "github-researcher",
    description: "Research GitHub issues/PRs",
    prompt: `
      Search GitHub for ${topic} issues and solutions.

      Find:
      - Closed issues related to ${problem}
      - Merged PRs implementing ${feature}
      - Community discussions on ${topic}
      - Known gotchas and workarounds

      Focus on ${relevantRepos} repositories.
      Provide issue links, status, and consensus solutions.
    `
  })] : [])
])
```

**Key points:**
- All spawned in single Task call block (parallel execution)
- Each has specific prompt tailored to feature context
- Prompts reference brainstorm decisions
- Results returned when all complete

## Synthesis

After all subagents complete, synthesize findings:

### Structure

```markdown
# Research: ${feature-name}

## Brainstorm Summary

${brief-summary-of-brainstorm-decisions}

## Codebase Findings (serena-explorer)

### Current Architecture

  - **Mitigation:** ${mitigation}

## Next Steps

Ready to write implementation plan with this research context.
```

## Auto-Save

After synthesis completes, automatically save to memory:

```typescript
// Use state-persistence skill
await saveResearchMemory({
  feature: extractFeatureName(brainstorm),
  content: synthesizedResearch,
  type: "research"
})
```

**Filename:** `YYYY-MM-DD-${feature-name}-research.md`

**Location:** Serena MCP memory (via write_memory tool)

## Handoff

After save completes, report to user:

```markdown
Research complete and saved to memory: ${filename}

I've synthesized findings from ${count} sources:
- Codebase: ${summary-of-serena-findings}
- Library docs: ${summary-of-context7-findings}
- Web: ${summary-of-web-findings}
- GitHub: ${summary-of-github-findings}

Key recommendation: ${one-sentence-approach}

Ready to write the implementation plan with this research context.
```

Then invoke `writing-plans` skill automatically.

## Error Handling

**If subagent fails:**
1. Continue with other subagents
2. Note missing research in synthesis
3. Offer to re-run failed researcher

**If no results found:**
1. Note in synthesis
2. Don't block workflow
3. Proceed with available research

**If all subagents fail:**
1. Report failure
2. Offer to proceed without research
3. User can retry or continue to planning
```

**Step 3: Verify file created**

```bash
cat cc/skills/research-orchestration/SKILL.md | head -50
```

Expected: Skill content visible

**Step 4: Commit**

```bash
git add cc/skills/research-orchestration/
git commit -m "feat: add research-orchestration skill"
```
